# Poetry App

This repository contains a poetry app developed using Java and XML for Android devices.
The app allows users to read and manage a collection of poems. It utilizes a PHP API with Retrofit for handling HTTP 
requests and communicating with a database.

## Features

The Poetry App provides the following features:

- Browse Poems: Users can explore a collection of poems.
- Read Poems: Users can view the content of individual poems.
- Add Poems: Users can contribute their own poems to the app.
- Update Poems: Users can edit and update the existing poems.
- Delete Poems: Users can remove unwanted poems from the collection.

``git clone https://github.com/shariar99/PoetryApp-With-Admin.git``


2. Import the project into Android Studio.

3. Set up the necessary configurations for the app (e.g., SDK versions, dependencies).

4. Make sure you have a compatible web server and database set up. 

5. Import the API file provided in the "API File For Admin" directory to your server.

6. Configure the app to connect to your database by updating the necessary URLs, credentials, and endpoints in the PHP API file and Retrofit service.

7. Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

## Dependencies

The Poetry App relies on the following dependencies:
